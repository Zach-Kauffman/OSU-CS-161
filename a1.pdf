Current major: Computer science, applied option. Looking to go into security

Minor: Math or music. Still undecided.

Sophomore year 18-19

Fall term:
	CS160 since I don't have the credit for it yet
	CS261 so I can go into pro school
	MUS108 for bacc requirements
	SOC206 for more bacc requirements

Winter term: 
	BI 102 for wrapping up bacc core
	CS 344 because it's the most interesting sounding CS class
	Last two classes dependent on outcome of this term.

Spring term:
	Completely undecided. I don't want to plan anything for this term
	as I may change my major from CS to math or music depending on how
	much I enjoy taking CS261 and 344.
